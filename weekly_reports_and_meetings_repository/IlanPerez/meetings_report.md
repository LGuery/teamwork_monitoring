### Date: 25th March 2020

## PhD meeting. Postponed meeting with Matthieu. Put :sunny: during confinment

Same presentation than [18th March 2020](#date-18th-march-2020) but corrected and presented to Matthieu t show him the progression for the 1st objectif of the thesis.

### Remarks

* Discussions about new moratorium: since January 2020 (Rec[19-02]), FAD fishing forbidden over all the Altlantic Ocean, for 2 months in 2020 and 3 months in 2021  

* Be more precise on ecological trap definition !!! :shipit: See Daniel's ppt  

* No R output in the slides (Try `r kable ()` for tables )  

* Correct some mistakes : #6/27, #5/27  

* Don't forget to be precise on the filter applied for doing graphs

* KEEP Brazilian data that are now corrected

* Matthieu : Need to sub-sample the data to have two comparable samples

* Still need to find a threshold of time at liberty


### What to do

* 1: Test Matching (cf emails from Matthieu) to create 2 sub-samples that are comparable between inside and outside the moratorium. "COntrole" sample with tunas from outside the moratorium. Don't forget to use only variables that are known at the tagging time, to keep RC-1 and RCF tunas.

* 2: compute monthly RR from November 2016 to 2019

* 3: "Spill probability" (Daniel Idea): look at tunas that are Re In & Rc Out + Re OUt & Rc In 
:arrow_right: Look at the travel distance 

* 4: Verify if moratorium forbids anvhored FAD fishing (Ask Sosthène)

* 5: Bibliographic rewiew for Ecological Trap and Bycatch papers from Daniel

* 6: take a look to the schedule: where are we ?


-------------------------------------------------------------------
### Date: 18th March 2020
## Presentation of exploration results and immobile structures effects

* I presented the "phd_meeting_13rdMarch.html" presentation available in my repository.

#### Questions/remarks

* Correct some mistakes in the presentation
* don't forget the references
* Find more recent data about FAD fisheries (slides 6-8)  

* Need to exclude tunas that are tagged and/or caught in January/February => no moratorium effect

* Try to do a 3D plot : time at lib, time and tagging location

#### What to to do next
* All explorations are good but we need to find a threshold for time at liberty to exclude tunas that are immediately recptured => in progress
-------------------------------------------------------------------
### Date: 20th January 2020
## First exploration of AOTTP data 


#### Results presented and issues/questions :question:  

* Presentation exploration about Relative Risk computation, in relation to time at liberty (period January-February) for juveniles YFT 
  + Can't explain the drop in RR between 0 and 10 daysj
  
  
* Distance = f(time at liberty)
  + No particular pattern  
  
  
#### What to explore next  
    
 * RR  
   + Extend the time at liberty after 60 days  
   + Find a way to check RR in relation to distance traveled 
   
 * Descriptive statistics:  
    + barplot distance traveled by tunas
    + barplot of velocity
    + compute maximal traveled distance with the maximum speed found in litterature:
    (Optimum = 25 km/h in Tuna: Physiology, Ecology and Evolution (2OO1),
    Max = 72 km/h in FAO from Magnuson (1978))  
    
   
  * Map6 :
    + What is this square at env. 9°N, -16°E ?  
    + Zoom on moratorium area to see what happens in Ivory cost
    + Count of CMR data



-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Date: 13th January 2020 

#Gipsy's script annotation discussion and first analysis planning 
#### Gipsy's script  

* Presentation of the content of the [.Rmd file](https://github.com/polarbear-tataki/tuna_dream_team/blob/master/obj_1_AOTTP_moratoria/GIPSY_TAGGING_AOTTP/tagging_data_explo_script_Ilan.md). Five parts in this script, everything is corrected. Some difference were found between Gipsy's paper and the results of the script. There are 4 more YFT individuals in the Table 3 generated by the script than the Table 3 in the paper.  
  
  
* Objectives for the following analysis:  
  + Compute Relative Risk in relation of time at liberty  
  + COmpute relative Risk in relation of distance traveled  
  + Comute RR for elder moratorium zone and period  
   
    
 * Afterwards  
   + Define a threshold distance/time traveled  
   + Use it to determine a consitent buffer



-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Date: 12nd December 2019

#Kick-off! :airplane: :rocket:  

#### Agenda  

* Presentation of the supervision team: Daniel, Lorelei and Matthieu  :busts_in_silhouette: : 


* Presenting the PhD project:
  + Objectives of the project:  
  
  :arrow_right: 3 big questions around the tropical tuna fisheries under FADs: :one: effects of FADs on high seas populations, communities & ecosystems, :two: efficiency of moratorias in Atlantic ocean and :three: we don't know what Fisheries Functionnal Zones (FFZ or ZFH) are for yellowfin (YFT), skipjack (SKPJ) and Big Eye (BET) tunas.  
  
  :arrow_right: This project aims to answer these questions in 4 steps:  
  
  :one:Use AOTTP (mark-recapture program in AO) data to evaluate the efficiency of current and past moratorias (2 periods x 2 zones)  
  
  :two:Defining ZFH for BET, YFT + SKJ in AO and IO using size and species structured, spatialized and time referenced (aggrgated 1°/month) landings data  :fish:  and define. A second part of this objective will be to link these data with environmental data (chl a, Temp, currents, sea height anomaly...)  
  
  :three:Assess the temporal and spatial evolution of ZFH, the connectivity between them and find if these zones are relevant for bycatch species as sharks  :shark:  
  
  :four: Use the knowledge acquired on ZFH to evalutate the moratorias and propose new type of moratorium based on adapted spatio-temporal strata  
  ry for 
  + Partipation to ICCAT  :earth_africa: & IOTC  :earth_asia: :  
  
 :arrow_right:16-23 July 2020: Dakar Symposium of AOTTP + Data preparatory

 * Implications of each supervisor :eyes: :  
 
 Everybody in copy of all emails, we'll see after  
 
 * Organization of meetings/reports :calendar: :
 
 :arrow_right: Weekly report each week on the [github](https://github.com/LGuery/teamwork_monitoring/tree/master/weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository/IlanPerez)  
 
 :arrow_right: 1 skype/month with Matthieu for briefing/avancement....  
 
 
  :arrow_right: Mini-commity each :three: months with a presentation of preliminary results :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
  
  :arrow_right: GDR Ecostat Grants to move to La Rochelle  
   
   
   * Communication & collaboration platforms :left_right_arrow: :  
   
   :arrow_right: GitHub will be used to monitor: :one: weekly the issues and solutions (see above), :two: the current work/scripts etc under .rmd format in the repository [tuna_dream_team](https://github.com/polarbear-tataki/tuna_dream_team) .  
   
   :arrow_right: [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TRQNP7NNQ/CRQNP8HC4) will be used to interact on diffrent subjects, in a clearer way than long strings of emails. We can follow what happens on the GitHub repository directly in the chanel discussion.
