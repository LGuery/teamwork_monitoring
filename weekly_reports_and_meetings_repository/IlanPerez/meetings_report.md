-------------------------------------------------------------------

### Date: 19th January 2020 First exploration of AOTTP data 


#### Results presented and issues/questions :question:  

* Presentation exploration about Relative Risk computation, in relation to time at liberty (period January-February) for juveniles YFT 
  + Can't explain the drop in RR between 0 and 10 days
  
  
* Distance = f(time at liberty)
  + No particular pattern  
  
  
#### What to explore next  
    
 * RR  
   + Extend the time at liberty after 60 days  
   + Find a way to check RR in relation to distance traveled 
   
 * Descriptive statistics:  
    + barplot distance traveled by tunas
    + barplot of velocity
    + compute maximal traveled distance with the maximum speed found in litterature:
    (Optimum = 25 km/h in Tuna: Physiology, Ecology and Evolution (2OO1),
    Max = 72 km/h in FAO from Magnuson (1978))  
    
  *
   
  * Map6 :
  + What is this square at env. 9°N, -16°E ?  
  + Zoom on moratorium area to see what happens in Ivory cost

### Date: 13th January 2020 Gipsy's script annotation discussion and first analysis planning 


#### Gipsy's script  

* Presentation of the content of the [.Rmd file](https://github.com/polarbear-tataki/tuna_dream_team/blob/master/obj_1_AOTTP_moratoria/GIPSY_TAGGING_AOTTP/tagging_data_explo_script_Ilan.md). Five parts in this script, everything is corrected. Some difference were found between Gipsy's paper and the results of the script. There are 4 more YFT individuals in the Table 3 generated by the script than the Table 3 in the paper.  
  
  
* Objectives for the following analysis:  
  + Compute Relative Risk in relation of time at liberty  
  + COmpute relative Risk in relation of distance traveled  
  + Comute RR for elder moratorium zone and period  
   
    
 * Afterwards  
   + Define a threshold distance/time traveled  
   + Use it to determine a consitent buffer

### Date: 12th December 2019 Kick-off! :airplane: :rocket:  

#### Agenda  

* Presentation of the supervision team: Daniel, Lorelei and Matthieu  :busts_in_silhouette: : 


* Presenting the PhD project:
  + Objectives of the project:  
  
  :arrow_right: 3 big questions around the tropical tuna fisheries under FADs: :one: effects of FADs on high seas populations, communities & ecosystems, :two: efficiency of moratorias in Atlantic ocean and :three: we don't know what Fisheries Functionnal Zones (FFZ or ZFH) are for yellowfin (YFT), skipjack (SKPJ) and Big Eye (BET) tunas.  
  
  :arrow_right: This project aims to answer these questions in 4 steps:  
  
  :one:Use AOTTP (mark-recapture program in AO) data to evaluate the efficiency of current and past moratorias (2 periods x 2 zones)  
  
  :two:Defining ZFH for BET, YFT + SKJ in AO and IO using size and species structured, spatialized and time referenced (aggrgated 1°/month) landings data  :fish:  and define. A second part of this objective will be to link these data with environmental data (chl a, Temp, currents, sea height anomaly...)  
  
  :three:Assess the temporal and spatial evolution of ZFH, the connectivity between them and find if these zones are relevant for bycatch species as sharks  :shark:  
  
  :four: Use the knowledge acquired on ZFH to evalutate the moratorias and propose new type of moratorium based on adapted spatio-temporal strata  
  ry for 
  + Partipation to ICCAT  :earth_africa: & IOTC  :earth_asia: :  
  
 :arrow_right:16-23 July 2020: Dakar Symposium of AOTTP + Data preparatory  
 
 :arrow_right: ~October 2020: Maldivies IOTC  
 
 :arrow_right: 2021: Working group "Ecosystems" ICCAT + Sharks  
 
 
 * Implications of each supervisor :eyes: :  
 
 Everybody in copy of all emails, we'll see after  
 
 * Organization of meetings/reports :calendar: :
 
 :arrow_right: Weekly report each week on the [github](https://github.com/LGuery/teamwork_monitoring/tree/master/weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository/IlanPerez)  
 
 :arrow_right: 1 skype/month with Matthieu for briefing/avancement....  
 
 
  :arrow_right: Mini-commity each :three: months with a presentation of preliminary results :chart_with_upwards_trend:  
  
  :arrow_right: GDR Ecostat Grants to move to La Rochelle  
   
   
   * Communication & collaboration platforms :left_right_arrow: :  
   
   :arrow_right: GitHub will be used to monitor: :one: weekly the issues and solutions (see above), :two: the current work/scripts etc under .rmd format in the repository [tuna_dream_team](https://github.com/polarbear-tataki/tuna_dream_team) .  
   
   :arrow_right: [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/TRQNP7NNQ/CRQNP8HC4) will be used to interact on diffrent subjects, in a clearer way than long strings of emails. We can follow what happens on the GitHub repository directly in the chanel discussion.
