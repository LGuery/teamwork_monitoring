# Welcome to the team / Bienvenue dans l'Ã©quipe!

Welcome to the team :tada::tada: 
I will gather some things here, which should make your life in the team hopefully enjoyable.
 
As a first step, you can have a look to the [weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository](https://github.com/LGuery/teamwork_monitoring/tree/master/weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository) in which you'll find a proposal on how to work together and a summary of our previous weekly meetings.
