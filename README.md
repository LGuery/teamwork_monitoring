# Welcome to the team / Bienvenue dans l'équipe!

Welcome to the team :tada::tada: We have gathered some things here, which should make your life in the team hopefully enjoyable.

If you have any question, do not hesitate to ask around or email [Loreleï](http://www.umr-marbec.fr/guery-lorelei.html), [Daniel](http://www.umr-marbec.fr/gaertner-daniel.html), [David](http://www.umr-marbec.fr/kaplan-david.html) or [Francis](http://www.umr-marbec.fr/marsac-francis.html).

Now that you're settled, have a look to the ressources we've made available to everyone. In priority, you should have a look to the [weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository](https://github.com/LGuery/teamwork_monitoring/tree/master/weekly_reports_and_meetings_repository) in which you'll find a proposal on how to work together and a summary of our previous weekly meetings.
